# BioFlight Project

This is an open-source repository for our research on sustainable solutions inspired by natural flight. Our goal is to develop innovative, eco-friendly technologies by studying the flight mechanisms of birds, insects, and other flying organisms.

## About

SustainLift Aerospace Researchers are dedicated to exploring and harnessing the principles of biological flight to create sustainable aviation solutions. Through this project, we aim to share our findings and collaborate with the wider community to advance green aviation practices.
